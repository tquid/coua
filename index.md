# World building

Players create the parameters of the world together. You can roll once for each column, or just choose what appeals to you.

## The Others

|     | Awareness            | Integration   | Prevalence          |
|:---:|:-------------------- |:------------- |:------------------- |
|  1  | Extremely privileged | Visitors only | Special individuals |
|  2  | Special knowledge    | Special sites | Some                |
|  3  | Controversial        | Neighborhoods | Quite a few         |
|  4  | Some deniers         | Most places   | A great many        |
|  5  | Fully                | Everywhere    | Ever-present        |

On a 6, roll *two* different sets of The Others. They are groups separated by ideology, biology, dimensional origin, or some other defining trait! Not that The Others in general cannot be diverse, but in this case, there are groups so distinct that they require different relationships altogether with humanity.

* Cohesion of Others - any factions?
* Attitude to humans? (Play a role in human life cycle; have entirely idiosyncratic motivations; overtly hostile; just other people)
  * Question here is what do they want?
* Are PCs Weird? All/None/Some?
* Connection to ordinary, civil powers?
* How clandestine is it?
* Who is calling the shots? Who really?
* How integrated are The Others? (Glamours to be able to deal with humans, “alien registration”, etc.; unintegrated with “gates” a la Toon Town)
* Overall Tone: Choose if light and silly, more serious, or grimdark
* System: hack of Kids on Brooms
